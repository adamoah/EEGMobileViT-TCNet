Abstract

Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is an important domain in the realm of Brain-Computer interface (BCI) research. To ensure BCI devices are capable of providing practical applications in the real world, brain signal processing techniques must be fast, accurate, and resource-conscious to deliver low-latency neural analytics. As a result, this study proposes the use of a lightweight, Transformer-based network for EEG gaze estimation. This approach involves leveraging a pre-trained MobileViT model alongside a Knowledge Distillation-based (KD) training procedure to develop a model with a balance of speed, accuracy, and size for EEG Eye Tracking (ET) tasks. Our results showcase this model is capable of performing at a level comparable (only 3\% lower) to the previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) on the EEGEyeNet Absolute Position Task while being 33\% faster and 60\% smaller than the SOTA. Our research presents a cost-effective model with applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices, and sets a baseline for expanding future research on lightweight, mobile-friendly models for EEG regression.
